# Image Captioning

Image Captioning is a project that generates textual descriptions for images using a deep learning-based approach. This repository contains the implementation of an encoder-decoder model leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image feature extraction and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for generating captions.

---

## Features
- **Automatic Image Captioning:** Generate human-like captions for images.
- **Deep Learning-Based:** Utilizes CNNs for feature extraction and RNNs (LSTMs or GRUs) for sequence generation.
- **Pretrained Models:** Includes support for pretrained CNN models like VGG16, ResNet50, or InceptionV3.
- **Custom Dataset Support:** Train on your custom image-caption datasets.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Shashi1119/Image_Captioning.git
   cd Image_Captioning
   ```

2. **Set Up the Environment:**
   Create a virtual environment and install the dependencies.
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # For Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Dataset

This project requires an image-caption dataset for training. Some common options include:
- [COCO (Common Objects in Context)](https://cocodataset.org/)
- [Flickr8k Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adityajn105/flickr8k)
- [Flickr30k Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hsankesara/flickr-image-dataset)

### Preparing the Dataset
1. Download the dataset of your choice.
2. Extract and organize the images and captions in the following structure:
   ```plaintext
   dataset/
   |-- images/
   |   |-- image1.jpg
   |   |-- image2.jpg
   |   |-- ...
   |-- captions.txt
   ```
3. Update the dataset path in the configuration file or script.

## Usage

### Training the Model
1. Prepare the dataset and organize it as mentioned.
2. Run the training script:
   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```

### Testing the Model
1. Provide the path to a test image:
   ```bash
   python test.py --image_path path/to/image.jpg
   ```
2. The script will display the image along with the generated caption.
